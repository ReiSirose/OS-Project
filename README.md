# üöÄ Computer Science Fundamentals: Self-Study & Projects

---

## Welcome! üëã

This repository is a testament to my ongoing journey of self-study and deep dive into the foundational pillars of computer science: **Operating Systems**, **Computer Networking**, and **C++ Programming**. As a Computer Science student, I believe a strong grasp of these core concepts is crucial for building robust and efficient software.

Here, you'll find a collection of my notes, exercises, and personal projects designed to solidify my understanding and apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. My aim is to continuously learn, explore, and master the underlying mechanisms that power our digital world.

## Why These Topics? ü§î

I've chosen to focus on Operating Systems, Networking, and C++ because they represent the bedrock of modern computing:

* **Operating Systems (OS):** Understanding how an OS manages resources, processes, memory, and file systems is fundamental to writing efficient and reliable code. It's the silent orchestrator behind every program we run.
* **Computer Networking:** From the internet to local area networks, networking knowledge is essential for building distributed systems and understanding how data travels across the globe. It's about how computers talk to each other.
* **C++ Programming:** C++ offers unparalleled control over system resources and performance, making it indispensable for low-level programming, game development, high-performance computing, and operating system development. It's where the rubber meets the road.

## My Learning Philosophy üß†

My approach to learning these complex topics involves a blend of theoretical understanding and practical application:

1.  **Theory First:** Gaining a solid understanding of the underlying principles from reputable textbooks, online courses, and academic papers.
2.  **Hands-On Implementation:** Writing code to apply concepts and see them in action. This often involves building small projects, re-implementing core functionalities, or solving specific programming challenges.
3.  **Problem Solving:** Tackling challenging problems and debugging issues to deepen understanding and develop critical thinking skills.
4.  **Documentation & Reflection:** Taking detailed notes, commenting code thoroughly, and documenting my thought process, as seen within this repository. This helps solidify learning and provides a clear record of my progress.
